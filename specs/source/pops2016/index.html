      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
This specification describes a signature suite created in 2016 that includes
the ability to cryptographically prove when the digital signature was
created by anchoring the signature to a hash in a publically
available merkle tree. This signature suite extends the
Linked Data Signatures [[LD-SIGNATURES]] specification. It uses the RDF
Dataset Normalization Algorithm [[RDF-DATASET-NORMALIZATION]] to transform the
input document into its normal form. It uses SHA-256 [[RFC6234]] as the
<a>message digest algorithm</a> and RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 [[RFC3447]] as the
<a>signature algorithm</a>. The major change addition to the signature
mechanism is the inclusion of several Merkle tree hashes into the signature
hash.

      <h2>Terminology</h2>
      <p>
The following terms are used to describe concepts involved in the
generation and verification of the Linked Data Signature 2015
<a>signature suite</a>.
      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt><dfn>merkle tree</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
A tree in which every non-leaf node is labelled with the hash of the labels
or values (in case of leaves) of its child nodes. Wikipedia has a more
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree">complete definition</a>.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>signature suite</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
A specified set of cryptographic primitives typically consisting of
a normalization algorithm, a message digest algorithm, and a signature
algorithm that are bundled together by cryptographers for developers
for the purposes of safety and convenience.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>normalization algorithm</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
An algorithm that takes an input document that has more than one possible
representation and always transforms it into a normal form. This process is
sometimes also called canonicalization.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>message digest algorithm</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
An algorithm that takes an input message and produces a cryptographic
output message that is often times many orders of magnitude smaller than the
input message. These algorithms are often 1) very fast, 2)
non-reversible, 3) change when even one bit of the input message changes, and
4) produce different outputs for different inputs.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>signature algorithm</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
An algorithm that takes an input message and produces an output value where the
receiver of the message can mathematically verify that the message came from
a particular sender and has not been modified in transit.

      <h2>Generating a Proof of Publication</h2>

      <p>
A <a>merkle tree</a>-based proof of publication is generated by adding a
value into a public <a>merkle tree</a> and then including that value in the
digital signature. There are several values that MUST be included in order
to ensure the proof is valid: the <var>merkle root</var>, the
<var>parent</var>, the <var>left sibling</var>, and
the <var>right sibling</var>.
      </p>
      <p class="issue">
Another alternative is to include the path from our entry back to the
merkle root. We're trying to minimize the data that goes into the
signature by making it extremely unlikely that the three hashes just happen
to be clustered elsewhere in the same tree.
      </p>
      <p>
To generate the <code>merklePublicationProof</code>, perform the following
steps:
      </p>
      <ol class="algorithm">
        <li>
Add an entry to a public <a>merkle tree</a>. Generate hashes for
the <var>merkle root</var>, the <var>parent</var>, the <var>left sibling</var>,
and the <var>right sibling</var> using the SHA-256 message digest algorithm
[[RFC6234]].
        </li>
        <li>
Generate <var>proof value</var> by joining the following strings in order,
using a colon <code>:</code> (U+003A) as the separator:
          <ol class="algorithm">
            <li>
<code>pops2016</code>
            </li>
            <li>
the SHA-256 message digest of the <var>merkle root</var>
            </li>
            <li>
the SHA-256 message digest of the <var>parent</var>
            </li>
            <li>
the SHA-256 message digest of the <var>left sibling</var>
            </li>
            <li>
the SHA-256 message digest of the <var>right sibling</var>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
Set the <code>merklePublicationProof</code> to <var>proof value</var>.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Modification to Algorithms</h2>

      <p>
The following modifications must be made to the algorithms specified in the
Linked Data Signatures [[LD-SIGNATURES]] specification.
      </p>

      <section>
      <h3>Signature Algorithm</h3>
      <p>
After performing step #4 and prior to performing step #5 of the
Signature Algorithm:
      </p>

      <ol class="algorithm">
        <li>
If a <code>merklePublicationProof</code> value exists, add an entry to
<var>headers</var> with a key of
<code>https://w3id.org/security#merklePublicationProof</code> and the
associated value.
        </li>
      </ol>
