      <p>
This specification describes a mechanism for ensuring the authenticity and
integrity of linked data documents using digital signatures.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id='sotd'>
      <p>
This is an experimental specification and is undergoing regular revisions. It
is not fit for production deployment.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
The term Linked Data is used to describe a recommended best practice for
exposing, sharing, and connecting information on the Web using standards,
such as URLs, to identify things and their properties. When information
is presented as Linked Data, other related information can be easily discovered
and new information can be easily linked to it. Linked Data is extensible in a
decentralized way, greatly reducing barriers to large scale integration.

With the increase in usage of Linked Data for a variety of applications, there
is a need to be able to verify the authenticity and integrity of Linked Data
documents. This specification adds authentication and integrity protection to
linked data documents through the use of public/private key cryptography
without sacrificing Linked Data features such as extensibility and
composability.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Design Goals and Rationale</h2>

      <p>
The Linked Data Signature specification achieves the following design goals:
      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt>Simple for Developers</dt>
        <dd>
The signature format is designed to be easy to use for developers that don't
have significant cryptography training. For example, signature suite identifiers
are used instead of specific cryptographic parameters to ensure that it is
difficult to accidentally produce a weak digital signature.
        </dd>

        <dt>Syntax Agnostic</dt>
        <dd>
The signature mechanism can be used across a variety of RDF data syntaxes such
as JSON-LD, N-Quads, and TURTLE, without the need to regenerate the signature.
        </dd>
        <dt>Agile</dt>
        <dd>
Since digital signature suites are compromised on a fairly regular basis, it
is important that suites can be easily and quickly replaced. This specification
provides algorithm agility while still keeping the digital signature format
easy for developers to understand.
        </dd>
        <dt>Extensible</dt>
        <dd>
Creating and deploying new signature suites is a fairly trivial undertaking
to ensure that the signature format increases the rate of innovation in the
digital signature space.
        </dd>

      </dl>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Terminology</h2>
      <p>
The following terms are used to describe concepts involved in the
generation and verification of Linked Data digital signatures.
      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt><dfn>linked data document</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
A document comprised of Linked Data.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>signed linked data document</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
A <a>linked data document</a> that has been digitally signed.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>linked data signature</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
A set of attributes that represent a Linked Data digital signature and
the parameters required to verify it.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>public key</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
A cryptographic key that can be used to verify digital signatures created
with a corresponding <a>private key</a>.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>private key</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
A cryptographic key that can be used to generate digital signatures.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>domain</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
A string value that specifies the operational domain of a digital signature.
This may be an Internet domain name like <code>example.com</code>, a
ad-hoc value such as <code>mycorp-level3-access</code>, or a very
specific transaction value like <code>8zF6T$mqP</code>. A signer may
include a <a>domain</a> in its digital signature to restrict its use
to particular target, identified by the specified <a>domain</a>.
      </dl>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Linked Data Signature Overview</h2>

      <p>
A <a>linked data signature</a> is compromised of information about the
signature, parameters required to verify it, and the signature value itself.
All of this information is provided using Linked Data vocabularies such as the
[[!SECURITY-VOCABULARY]].
      </p>

      <p>
        At a minimum, a <a>linked data signature</a> must have the
        following attributes:
      </p>

      <dl style="margin-left: 1em;">
        <dt><code>type</code><dt>
        <dd>
A URI that identifies the digital signature suite that was used to create the
signature. For example: <code>LinkedDataSignature2015</code>.</dd>
        <dt><code>creator</code><dt>
        <dd>
A URI that identifies the public/private key pair associated with the
signature. The URI SHOULD be a URL that can be dereferenced to obtain a
linked data document that contains a link identifying the entity that owns
the key pair. Dereferencing the entity link SHOULD result in a Linked Data
document that contains a link back to the URL identifier for the
public/private key pair, thereby proving ownership.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>created</dfn><dt>
        <dd>
The string value of an [[!ISO8601]] combined date and time string generated
by the <a href="#signature-algorithm">Signature Algorithm</a>.
        </dd>
        <dt><code>domain</code> (optional)<dt>
        <dd>
A string value specifying the restricted <a>domain</a> of the signature.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>nonce</dfn> (optional, but strongly recommended)<dt>
        <dd>
A string value that is included in the digital signature and MUST only be
used once for a particular <a>domain</a> and window of time. This
value is used to mitigate replay attacks.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>signatureValue</dfn><dt>
        <dd>
The value of the <em>signature value</em> generated by the
<a href="#signature-algorithm">Signature Algorithm</a>.
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <p>
A signature can be added to a Linked Data document like the following:
      </p>

      <pre class="example highlight" title="A simple Linked Data document">
{
  "@context": "https://w3id.org/identity/v1",
  "title": "Hello World!"
}
      </pre>

      <p>
by adding the parameters outlined in this section:
      </p>

      <pre class="example highlight" title="A simple signed Linked Data document">
{
  "@context": "https://w3id.org/identity/v1",
  "title": "Hello World!",
  "signature": {
    "type": "LinkedDataSignature2015",
    "creator": "http://example.com/i/pat/keys/5",
    "created": "2011-09-23T20:21:34Z",
    "domain": "example.org",
    "nonce": "2bbgh3dgjg2302d-d2b3gi423d42",
    "signatureValue": "OGQzNGVkMzVm4NTIyZTkZDY...NmExMgoYzI43Q3ODIyOWM32NjI="
  }
}
      </pre>

      <p>
The signature example above uses the <code>LinkedDataSignature2015</code>
signature suite to produce a verifiable digital signature.
      </p>

<div class="issue">Create a separate section detailing an optional mechanism
for authenticating public key ownership via bi-directional links. How
to establish trust in key owner entities is out of scope but examples can
be given.</div>

<div class="issue">Specify algorithm agility mechanisms (additional attributes
from the security vocab can be used to indicate other signing and hash
algorithms). Rewrite algorithms to be parameterized on this basis and
move `LinkedDataSignature2015` definition to a single supported
mechanism; specify its identifier as a URL. In order to make it easy to
specify a variety of combinations of algorithms, introduce a core
type `LinkedDataSignature` that allows for easy filtering/discover of
signature nodes, but that type on its own doesn't specify any default
signature or hash algorithms, those must be given via other properties in the
nodes.</div>

<div class="issue">Specify that linked data documents are syntax agnostic.
Specify the URLs that property values like <code>signature</code> map to,
for instance, in the security vocabulary.</div>

<div class="issue">Add a note indicating that this specification should not
be construed to indicate that public key owners should be restricted to a
single public key or that systems that use this spec and involve real people
should identify each person as only ever being a single entity rather than
perhaps N entities with M keys. There are no such restrictions and in many
cases those kinds of restrictions are ill-advised due to privacy
considerations.</div>

    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Signature Algorithm</h2>

<div class="issue">The signature parameters should be included as headers
and values in the data to be signed.</div>

      <p>
The following algorithm specifies how to create a digital signature that can
be later used to verify the authenticity and integrity of a
<a>linked data document</a>. A <a>linked data document</a>,
<var>document</var>, a <a>private key</a>, and an identifier for the
public/private key pair, <var>creator</var>, are required inputs. A
<a>nonce</a> and a <a>domain</a> may also be optionally specified
as inputs. A <a>signed linked data document</a> is produced as output.
Whenever this algorithm must encode strings, it uses UTF-8 encoding.
      </p>

      <ol class="algorithm">
        <li>
Create a copy of <var>document</var>, <var>output</var>.
        </li>
        <li>
Remove any <code>signature</code> nodes from the default graph in
<var>output</var>.
        </li>
        <li>
Generate a <var>normalized document</var> by normalizing
<var>document</var> according to a <var>normalization algorithm</var>
(e.g. the <em>URDNA2015</em> [[!RDF-DATASET-NORMALIZATION]] algorithm).
        </li>
        <li>
Generate an ISO8601 combined date and time string, <var>created</var>
containing the current date and time, accurate to at least one second, in
Universal Time Code format. For example: <code>2011-09-23T20:21:34Z</code>. Add
an entry to <var>headers</var> with a key of <code>http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/created</code>
and a value of <var>created</var>.
        </li>
        <li>
Create a value <var>tbs</var> that represents the data to be signed, and
set it to the result of running the
<a href="#create-verify-hash-algorithm">Create Verify Hash Algorithm</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
Digitally sign <var>tbs</var> using the <a>private key</a> and the
the <var>digital signature algorithm</var> (e.g. <em>RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5</em> 
[[!PKCS1]]) and base-64 encode the resulting value. The resulting base-64 
encoded string is the <a>signatureValue</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
Add a <code>signature</code> node to <var>output</var> containing
a <a>linked data signature</a> using the appropriate 
<var>type</var>, <var>creator</var>, <var>created</var>, <a>signatureValue</a>, 
and if given, the <a>nonce</a>, and <a>domain</a>.

Return <var>output</var> as the <a>signed linked data document</a>.

    <section>
      <h2>Signature Verification Algorithm</h2>
      <p>
The following algorithm specifies how to check the authenticity and
integrity of a <a>signed linked data document</a> by verifying its
digital signature. This algorithm takes a
<a>signed linked data document</a>, <var>signed document</var> and
outputs a <code>true</code> or </code>false</code> value based on whether or
not the digital signature on <var>signed document</var> was verified. Whenever
this algorithm must encode strings, it uses UTF-8 encoding.
      </p>

<div class="issue">Specify how the public key can be obtained (through
some out-of-band process and passed in or it can be retrieved by
derefencing its URL identifier, etc.</div>

      <ol class="algorithm">
        <li>
Get the <a>public key</a> by dereferencing its URL identifier in
the <code>signature</code> node of the default graph of
<var>signed document</var>. Confirm that the <a>linked data document</a>
that describes the <a>public key</a> specifies its owner and that its
owner's URL identifier can be dereferenced to reveal a bi-directional link back
to the key. Ensure that the key's owner is a trusted entity before proceeding
to the next step.
        </li>
        <li>
Let <var>document</var> be a copy of <var>signed document</var>.

        <li>
Generate a <var>normalized document</var> by normalizing
<var>document</var> according to the <var>normalization algorithm</var>
(e.g. the </var><em>URDNA2015</em> [[!RDF-DATASET-NORMALIZATION]] algorithm).
        </li>
        <li>
Create a value <var>tbv</var> that represents the data to be verified, and
set it to the result of running the
