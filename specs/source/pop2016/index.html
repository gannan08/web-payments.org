      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
This specification describes a signature option that provides
the ability to cryptographically prove when a digital signature was

<a>signature options</a> data structure used in the
Linked Data Signatures [[!LD-SIGNATURES]] specification.

      <h2>Constructing a Proof of Publication</h2>

      <p>
A <a>merkle tree</a>-based proof of publication is generated by adding a
merkle tree root hash value into a ledger
then including a proof in the digital signature. There are several values
that MUST be included in order to ensure the proof is valid:
a proof of publication <var>algorithm identifier</var>,
a <var>ledger identifier</var>, a <var>transaction identifier</var>,
the <var>merkle root hash</var> and an <var>array of proofs</var> where each
entry in the array is a combination of the <var>parent</var>,
the <var>left sibling</var>, and the <var>right sibling</var>.
      </p>
      <p class="issue">
Another alternative is to include the path from our entry back to the
merkle root. We're trying to minimize the data that goes into the
signature by making it extremely unlikely that the three hashes just happen
to be clustered elsewhere in the same tree. We need to calculate the
statistical probability of this happening (hint: it's fantastically unlikely,
but we need to think through the threat model).
      </p>

      <p class="issue">
This algorithm is still too vague for implementers. For example: How do you
know what information to include in the merkle leaf nodes when generating the
hash? Do you just include all of it? Is it okay to select the same
message digest algorithm as what's used in the active signature suite?
      </p>
      <p>
To generate the proof of publication, perform the following steps:
      </p>
      <ol class="algorithm">
        <li>
Add all desired entries to a merkle tree.
        </li>
        <li>
Let <var>array of entries</var> be an empty array.
        </li>
        <li>
For each merkle tree entry that is being included in the proof, add an
entry to <var>array of entries</var> with the following key-value pairs:
         <dl>
           <dt>merkleParent</dt>
           <dd>
A message digest of the parent node for the entry in the merkle tree using
the same message digest algorithm as specified in the
active <a>signature suite</a>.
           </dd>
           <dt>merkleLeftSibling</dt>
           <dd>
A message digest of the left sibling node for the entry in the merkel tree
using the same message digest algorithm as specified in the active
<a>signature suite</a>.
           </dd>
           <dt>merkleRightSibling</dt>
           <dd>
A message digest of the right sibling node for the entry in the merkel tree
using the same message digest algorithm as specified in the active
<a>signature suite</a>.
           </dd>
         </dl>
        </li>
        <li>
Let <var>merkle root hash</var> be the hash of the root node of the
<a>merkle tree</a> using the same message digest algorithm as specified in
the active <a>signature suite</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
Add the <var>merkle root hash</var> to the ledger recording the
<var>ledger identifier</var> and the <var>transaction identifier</var>.
        </li>
        <li>
Return the following data structure:
          <dl>
            <dt>type</dt>
            <dd>
The value <code>PoP2016</code>.
            </dd>
            <dt>ledger</dt>
            <dd>
The value of <var>ledger identifier</var>.
<div class="issue">
Should this be a URL? URN? We should probably not require a registry.
</div>
            </dd>
            <dt>transactionId</dt>
            <dd>
The value of <var>transaction identifier</var>.
            </dd>
            <dt>merkleRoot</dt>
            <dd>
The value of <var>merkle root hash</var>.
            </dd>
            <dt>proof</dt>
            <dd>
The value of <var>array of entries</var>.
            </dd>
          </dl>
        </li>
      </ol>

The data structure returned above should then be associated with a
<code>merklePublicationProof</code> and included in
<a>signature options</a> before the signature is generated.

    <section>
      <h2>Verifying a Proof of Publication</h2>

      <p>
A <a>merkle tree</a>-based proof of publication is verified by checking to
see if a value exists in a ledger at the appropriate time.
The input is a <a>signature options</a> document containing a
<code>merklePublicationProof</code> entry. The output is
<em>true</em> if the proof is valid, or <em>false</em> if it is not.
      </p>

      <p>
To verify the proof of publication, perform the following steps:
      </p>
      <ol class="algorithm">
        <li>
Ensure that the <code>type</code> value is <code>PoP2016</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
Extract the <var>ledger identifier</var>, the
<var>transaction identifier</var>, and <var>merkle root hash</var> from the
<var>signature options</var>.
        </li>
        <li>
If the <var>merkle root hash</var> does not exist in the transaction
identified by <var>transaction identifier</var> on the ledger identified by
<var>ledger identifier</var>, return false.

          <div class="issue">
This isn't right, we need to also check a timestamp of some kind. We have
a timestamp in the Linked Data Signature, but it may not be aligned w/
the timestamp in the ledger. What timing tolerances do we allow? Should
we just record the ledger transaction timestamp?
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
Extract <var>array of entries</var> from the <var>signature options</var>.
        </li>
        <li>
For each <var>entry</var> in <var>array of entries</var>:
          <ol class="algorithm">
            <li>
If the <var>parent</var>, <var>left sibling</var>, and <var>right sibling</var>,
does not exist in the <var>merkle tree</var>, return false.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
Return true.
        </li>
