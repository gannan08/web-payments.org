This specification describes a standard signature suite created in 2015 for the
Linked Data Signatures specification.

    <section id='sotd'>

This is an experimental specification and is undergoing regular revisions. It
is not fit for production deployment.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
This specification describes a standard signature suite created in 2015 for the
Linked Data Signatures [[LD-SIGNATURES]] specification. It uses the RDF
Dataset Normalization Algorithm [[RDF-DATASET-NORMALIZATION]] to transform the
input document into its canonical form. It uses SHA-256 [[RFC6234]] as the
<a>message digest algorithm</a> and RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 [[RFC3447]] as the
<a>signature algorithm</a>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Terminology</h2>
      <p>
The following terms are used to describe concepts involved in the
generation and verification of the Linked Data Signature 2015
<a>signature suite</a>.
      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt><dfn>signature suite</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
A specified set of cryptographic primitives typically consisting of
a canonicalization algorithm, a message digest algorithm, and a signature
algorithm that are bundled together by cryptographers for developers
for the purposes of safety and convenience.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>canonicalization algorithm</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
An algorithm that takes an input document that has more than one possible
representation and always transforms it into a canonical form. This process is
sometimes also called normalization.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>message digest algorithm</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
An algorithm that takes an input message and produces a cryptographic
output message that is often many orders of magnitude smaller than the
input message. These algorithms are often 1) very fast, 2)
non-reversible, 3) cause the output to change significantly when even one
bit of the input message changes, and 4) make it infeasible to find two
different inputs for the same output.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>signature algorithm</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
An algorithm that takes an input message and produces an output value where the
receiver of the message can mathematically verify that the message has not
been modified in transit and came from someone possessing a particular secret.
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <h2>The Linked Data Signature 2015 Signature Suite</h2>

      <p>
The Linked Data Signature 2015 <a>signature suite</a> MUST be used in
conjunction with the signing and verification algorithms in the
Linked Data Signatures [[LD-SIGNATURES]] specification. The suite consists of
the following algorithms:

      <h2>Modification to Algorithms</h2>

      <p>
The following algorithm replaces the Create Verify Hash Algorithm from the
Linked Data Signature specification.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h3>Create Verify Hash Algorithm</h3>
        <p>
The following algorithm specifies how to create the data that is used
to generate or verify a digital signature. It takes a canonicalized
<a>linked data document</a>, <var>canonicalized document</var>, combined
date and time string, <var>created</var>, and an optionally, a
<a>nonce</a> and <a>domain</a>. Its output is a message digest that
can be used to generate or verify a digital signature.
        </p>

        <ol class="algorithm">
          <li>
Create an empty map of header names to header values, <var>headers</var>.
          </li>
          <li>
Add an entry to <var>headers</var> with a key of
<code>http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/created</code> and a value of
<var>created</var>.
          </li>
          <li>
If a <a>domain</a> is specified, add an entry to <var>headers</var> with
a key of <code>https://w3id.org/security#domain</code> and a value of the
<a>domain</a>.

          <li>
If a <a>nonce</a> is specified, add an entry to <var>headers</var> with
a key of <code>https://w3id.org/security#nonce</code> and a value of the
<a>nonce</a>.
          <li>
Create an empty string <var>output</var> that represents the data to be signed
or verified.
          </li>
          <li>

Append a colon, <code>:</code> (U+003A), and one space (U+0020),
to <var>output</var>.

Append <var>value</var> to <var>output</var>.

          </li>
          <li>
Hash <var>output</var> using the <a>message digest algorithm</a>
 (e.g. SHA-256) and replace it with the result.
