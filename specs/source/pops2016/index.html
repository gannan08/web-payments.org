      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
This specification describes a signature option that provides
the ability to cryptographically prove when a digital signature was
created by anchoring the signature to a hash in a publically
available merkle tree. This signature option is intended to be used with the
<a>signature options</a> data structure used in the
Linked Data Signatures [[!LD-SIGNATURES]] specification.

      <h2>Terminology</h2>
      <p>
The following terms are used to describe concepts involved in the
generation and verification of the Proof of Publication signature option.
      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt><dfn>signature options</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
A set of options that is included in the Linked Data Signatures
[[!LD-SIGNATURES]] signature data.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>merkle tree</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
A tree in which every non-leaf node is labelled with the hash of the labels
or values (in case of leaves) of its child nodes. Wikipedia has a more
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree">complete definition</a>.
        </dd>
        <dt><dfn>signature suite</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
A specified set of cryptographic primitives typically consisting of
a canonicalization algorithm, a message digest algorithm, and a signature
algorithm that are bundled together by cryptographers for developers
for the purposes of safety and convenience.

      <h2>Constructing a Proof of Publication</h2>

      <p>
A <a>merkle tree</a>-based proof of publication is generated by adding a
value into a public <a>merkle tree</a> and then including that value in the
digital signature. There are several values that MUST be included in order
to ensure the proof is valid: an identifier for the <a>merkle tree</a>,
</a></var>the <var>merkle root</var>, the <var>parent</var>,
the <var>left sibling</var>, and the <var>right sibling</var>.
      </p>
      <p class="issue">
Another alternative is to include the path from our entry back to the
merkle root. We're trying to minimize the data that goes into the
signature by making it extremely unlikely that the three hashes just happen
to be clustered elsewhere in the same tree.
      </p>

      <p class="issue">
This algorithm is still too vague for implementers. For example: How do you
know what information to include in the merkle leaf nodes when generating the
hash? Do you just include all of it?
      </p>
      <p>
To generate the <var>proof</var>, perform the following steps:
      </p>
      <ol class="algorithm">
        <li>
Add an entry to a public <a>merkle tree</a>. Generate hashes for
the <var>merkle root</var>, the <var>parent</var>, the <var>left sibling</var>,
and the <var>right sibling</var> using the same message digest algorithm
that will be used by the <a>signature suite</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
Generate <var>proof value</var> by joining the following strings in order,
using a colon <code>:</code> (U+003A) as the separator:
          <ol class="algorithm">
            <li>
<code>popso1</code>
            </li>
            <li>
a URL-encoded identifier for the <a>merkle tree</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
the message digest of the <var>merkle root</var> using the same message
digest algorithm specified in the active <a>signature suite</a>
            </li>
            <li>
the message digest of the <var>parent</var> using the same message
digest algorithm specified in the active <a>signature suite</a>
            </li>
            <li>
the message digest of the <var>left sibling</var> using the same message
digest algorithm specified in the active <a>signature suite</a>
            </li>
            <li>
the message digest of the <var>right sibling</var> using the same message
digest algorithm specified in the active <a>signature suite</a>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
Set <var>proof</var> to <var>proof value</var>.
        </li>
      </ol>

The <var>proof</var> should then be associated with a
<code>merklePublicationProof</code> key and included in
<a>signature options</a> before the signature is generated.
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Verifying a Proof of Publication</h2>

      <p>
A <a>merkle tree</a>-based proof of publication is verified by checking to
see if a value exists in a public <a>merkle tree</a> and was generated by the
expected party and the expected time. The input is a <a>signature options</a>
document containing a <code>merklePublicationProof</code> entry. The output is
<em>true</em> if the proof is valid, or <em>false</em> if it is not.
      </p>

      <p>
To verify the <var>proof</var>, perform the following steps:
      </p>
      <ol class="algorithm">
        <li>
Extract the <var>algorithm</var>, the <var>identifier</var>,
</var> the <var>merkle root</var>, the <var>parent</var>,
the <var>left sibling</var>, and the <var>right sibling</var> by splitting the
<code>merklePublicationProof</code> value using colon <code>:</code> (U+003A)
as the separator value.
        </li>
        <li>
Set <var>identifier</var> to the URL-decoded version of itself.
        </li>
        <li>
Ensure that <var>algorithm</var> is equivalent to <code>popso1</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
Load the <a>merkle tree</a> identified by <var>identifier</var>.
        </li>
        <li>
If the <var>merkle root</var>, the <var>parent</var>,
the <var>left sibling</var>, and the <var>right sibling</var> exist in the
<a>merkle tree</a> return true. Otherwise, return false.

          <div class="issue">
This isn't right, we need to also check a timestamp of some kind. What
would be the best/most generic way of doing that?
          </div>
        </li>
      </ol>
